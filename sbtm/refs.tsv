7	1	"To be sure, not all scholarship on the subject maintains this essential distinction. Scholars as insightful as Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (2012), for example, use the term ""nation"" as a mere synonym for ""independent country,"" as is reflected in the title of their important book <i>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty</i>. Revealingly, such terms as ""nation"" and ""nation-state"" do not appear in the book's index. <br><br> Similarly, Philip G. Roeder (2007, 3, 12), in a perceptive study of the origin of the nation-state (focusing on the former Soviet Union), argued that in mid-2006 the world contained 192 nation-states (the members of the United Nations), as well as one potential nation-state, Taiwan. Yet he also allows that ""there may be as many as six to eight hundred active nation-state projects and another seven to eight thousand potential projects,"" defining a ""nation-state project as ""a claim that a specific population (purportedly a nation) should be self-governing within a sovereign state of its own."""

We also largely concur with Patrick Geary's (2002) counter-contention that nationalist ideology has led many scholars to overplay the national rooting and ethnic cohesion of European states, although we suspect that he engages in hyperbole of his own in arguing that ""the history of Europe's nations ... has turned our understanding of the past into a toxic waste dump, filled with the poison of ethnic nationalism ...""

50	1	"The convergence of the three basic terms employed in the standard model of geopolitics has its own long history, one that highlights some of the complexities and contradictions inherent in the larger schema. A brief etymological digression may clarify what we are dealing with here.<br><br>The term ""nation"" derives from a Latin word meaning ""to be born,"" which eventually came to refer to groups of people purportedly descended from the same ancestors. As Raymond Williams noted in <i>Keywords</i> (1985, 178), ""nation"" was essentially a racial term for most of its history. Its definitions subsequently branched off in several directions, coming to refer to entities as diverse as home-town associations of students at Swedish universities and sovereign states. The racial origins of the term might seem to nudge its current connotations toward an ethnic conception of nationality, foregrounding concerns about the resurgence of ethnonationalist discourse. What is striking, however, was the rapidity with which ""nation"" switched from a predominantly racial to a culturally neutral geopolitical term, with prominent authors ignoring the intermediate ethnonational stage in which the nation was most often conceived as a self-consciously political community united by cultural (especially linguistic) commonalities. As recently as 1936, for example, the influential geographer Griffith Taylor regretted that most laymen still incorrectly used the terms race and nation as synonyms (1936, 21)&mdash;an observation that most laypeople today would probably find baffling. Yet Taylor (1936, 21) went on to argue that ""nation"" had by this time more properly come to mean simply ""the body of inhabitants of a country united under an independent government of their own."" Taylor thus classified all sovereign states as nations, regardless of their cultural or political characteristics&mdash;or their degree of national cohesion. Such effacement of its own evolution, we suspect, is one reason why ""nation"" has come to be such a troublesome term.<br><br>""State,"" like ""nation,"" also derives ultimately from Latin, stemming from stare, ""to stand."" Today the English meanings of ""state"" are wide indeed, referring most broadly (as a noun) to ""condition, manner of existing,"" as in the phrase ""state of mind"" (OED, 1971, Volume II, 3025). Its political referent, which evidently dates to the late 13th century, ""grew out of the meaning 'conditions of a country' with regard to government, prosperity, etc."" (<a class='reflink' target='_blank' href='https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=state'><i>Online Etymological Dictionary</i></a>).<br><br>From denoting the mere circumstances of the polity, ""state"" came to mean the government itself, and then gradually extended to include the lands and people under the government's authority. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (OED) gives this definition in its 29th entry under ""state,"" where it is defined as ""the supreme civil power and government vested in a country or nation."" That usage emerged as early as 1538 (1971, 3025). Intriguingly, the 30th definition provided by the OED, also dating to the sixteenth century, points toward the eventual convergence of all three key geopolitical terms: ""State: A body of people occupying a defined territory and organized under a sovereign government. Hence the territory ... occupied by such a body.""<br><br>""Country"" likewise comes from Latin, deriving from <i>contra</i>, ""against or opposite"" (Williams 1985, 71). This term came to denote the land lying ""over there,"" away from some key vantage point. In this sense, ""country"" referred to areas removed from the center of power, especially those of a rustic nature. The English word retains this definition, used in such constructions as ""country music"" and ""the countryside."" Eventually, ""country"" also came to mean any expanse of land associated with some specific feature, be it a particular human group (as in ""the Basque country"") or even physiographical attributes (""the high country""). As to its specifically geopolitical usage, the shift from denoting an area removed from the center of power to one focused on but extending well beyond that same center is a striking case of a word coming to mean something entirely opposed to its original definition. Thus Singapore is now regarded as a country, albeit one without a countryside to speak of.<br><br>Etymological tracing is a fraught pursuit, considering the transformations that words routinely undergo. This exploration of ""nation,"" ""state,"" and ""country"" is meant to be suggestive only, offered to provoke thought rather than to lead to any solid conclusions. After all, the etymologically informed statement that ""our family [nation] stands together [state] over there [country]"" is not exactly a promising foundation for a geopolitical order."

The origin of the state has been traced back some 5,000 years to the first organized polities with permanent institutions. Many writers, however, hold that the vast majority of early states, including those of medieval Europe, were too disorganized and based too much on personal relationships to merit the label (see Davies 2003). Robert Jackson similarly denies state-level status to pre-colonial African polities, while allowing that they formed states ""in the looser anthropological definition"" (1990, 68). Martin van Creveld (1999, 1) goes so far as to contend that the state is a ""subspecies"" of the corporation and did not emerge until the modern era. But scholars who define the term more broadly classify all manner of organized political communities as ""states,"" including those of so-called Dark Age Europe. As Chris Wickham (2016:12) has cogently observed, ""the public authority of kings in the early middle ages ... can ...be usefully characterized in terms of state power."""

But he denied that it could be <i>divided</i> between or among these three elements (see Andrew 2011, 77). This assertion, as Bodin understood, ran counter to most classical theories of political order. Polybius, for example, drawing on Aristotle, argued that much of Republican Rome's power was derived from its mixed constitution in which sovereign authority was divided in a complex manner among the one (the consuls, actually two in number), the few (the senate), and the many (the popular assemblies).

That was certainly not the case in most medieval European polities, which grew and shrank through dynastic succession and the awarding of landed dowries. The so-called Angevin Empire, for example, had some control over scattered and periodically changing territories, but that hardly made it a territorial state. On the history of the idea of ""territory"" more generally, see Elden (2013)."

The actual heyday of this model was surprisingly short, essentially lasting from 1960, when 17 African countries gained independence, to 1991-1993, when three important putative nation-states&mdash;the USSR, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia&mdash;collapsed, eventually yielding 24 new states. Not coincidentally, the end of the Cold War in 1991 also saw the disintegration of Somalia."

As William Rankin (2016, 66) further argues, through the mid-twentieth century, international mapping was primarily ""a way for a country to fit itself, both politically and graphically, into the universalizing framework of the singular, objective base map."" Rankin is referring here especially to the monumentally ambitious International Map of the World project, which sought to fit all national surveys onto a uniform planetary grid. He goes on to argue, however, that as the turn of the millennium approached, new global visions&mdash;propelled by novel technologies, particularly GPS (Global Positioning System)&mdash;gradually undermined this dream. As he puts it (2016, 68), ""Territorial states were no longer the building blocks of worldwide geography."" Anachronistic though it may be, however, the earlier vision remains embedded in the omnipresent world political map. Here, more than anywhere else, one finds a document whose main effect is to ""advance the strength and stability of national territorial states."" Just as states are effectively depicted as if they were natural phenomena, nations were at one time commonly theorized to be natural units of humankind, formed by common descent and marked off from their neighbors by supposed cultural and ""racial"" features. As Lee Buchhheit (1978, 4) put it, ""Self-determination was therefore to borrow from nationalism the conviction that societies could be broken down into 'natural' political units, loosely given the title of 'nations.'"""
12	0	"As a result, we reject the harshest critics of cartography, who see only propaganda and self-aggrandizement in the entire exercise. Steven Seegel (2018), to take an extreme example, argues that ""all maps are epistemically groundless, nihilistic, or surreal"" (p. 228). As he notes, the core argument of  his book <i>Map Men</i> is that ""interest in maps was often pathological"" (page 3). <br> To be fair, Seegel (2018, 228) hedges his argument a bit, noting that ""It might be better to say"" that ""all maps are epistemically groundless."" Nonetheless, he finds evidence of ""pathology"" in five important early twentieth-century geographers: Albrecht Penck, Eugeniusz Romer, Stepan Rudnyts'kyi, Isaiah Bowman, and Pal Teleki. Even if Seegel's assessments of these scholars were fair, his larger arguments would not follow. One could surely find important economists who held objectionable views and made dubious claims, but would be enough to prove that economic models tout court are ""epistemically groundless, nihilistic, or surreal""? Or would a study of illiberal ""Verse Men"" like T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis justify a conclusion that poetry is intrinsically retrograde, with the only ""antidote"" being the production of mock epics and humorous doggerel? (The latter is analogous to the recommendation that Seegel [2018, 229-230] provides for would-be map-makers.) To the contrary, we regard maps, models, and poems alike as indispensable despite their flaws. "

18	0	"On the right, a few serious writers have sought to rehabilitate ethno-nationalism. Yoram Hazony's (2018) <i>The Virtue of Nationalism</i>, acclaimed in the United States as the ""Conservative Book of the Year"" in 2019, argues that all successful nation-states require ethnonational foundations, binding their people together&mdash;and distinguishing them from others&mdash;by commonalities of language, religion, and custom. Hazony doubts the coherence if not the very existence of civic nations, a position that has scant empirical support (as we will discuss in Chapter 3). Enthusiasm for Hazony's larger thesis on the part of conservative and centrist thinkers in the United States is curious, for it runs counter to the historical trans-partisan emphasis on America's own national creed, which downplays ethnic elements and foregrounds public ideas and ideals. As the neoconservative writer Robert Kagan framed the issue in 2006, ""the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution produced a different kind of nationalism"" from that emerging in Europe at the same time. In the early Republic, national unity was based not on ""common ancestry, common history, and common land but [on] common allegiance to liberal republican ideology"" (Kagan 2006, 4; see also pages 152-153). Kagan's formulation may be exaggerated; a common history, land, and language are indeed wrapped up in the American story. Yet these features have traditionally been ascribed a secondary role. <br> Countering the ethno-nationalist trend are a number of recent books by prominent American public intellectuals of diverse political inclination who advocate instead a more encompassing version of civic nationalism. Francis Fukuyama (2018) shows how different national identities have emerged along different paths, some turning toward ethnic-group inclusion and exclusion while others move toward cultural pluralism. Focusing on the United States, Jill Lepore (2019) emphasizes the often-thwarted promise of progressive liberalism found in civic nationalism. Similarly, John Judis (2018) contends that civic nationalism allows the maintenance of the welfare state while warding off the excesses of globalization precisely by contributing to a vibrant international order. From a more conservative perspective, Amy Chua (2018) argues that the United States is unique precisely because its ""national identity is not defined by the identity of any one of the innumerable ethnic subgroups that make up the U.S. population"" (2018, 11). And although the nationalist conservative Rich Lowry (2019) dismisses civic nationalism as a mere illusion, he nonetheless upholds its basic principles, opining that ""America largely fulfills the standards of a civic nation..."" (2019, 19). <br>This drive to rehabilitate civic nationalism has much to recommend it. But it sometimes untethers the United States from the complexities of the global whole. Lepore, for example, contends that America occupies a position ""as rare as hens' teeth"" because ""it was a state before it became a nation"" and is thus better conceptualized as a ""state-nation"" than as a ""nation-state"" (2019, 33). While astute as a characterization of the United States, this condition is not so unusual as she seems to think. Only a handful of countries, mostly located in central and eastern Europe, saw the development of national identity precede the creation of the state associated with it. In the usual course of history, the state has contributed substantially to building its nation. If the United States has a unique form of nationalism, its special feature lies elsewhere, particularly in the fact that its principles were expressly and eloquently articulated, albeit often hypocritically, by its founding leaders. But similar forms of civic nationalism, marked by an equally powerful ability to incorporate and acculturate immigrants of varied ethnic stock, emerged in a number of other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. <br>It is also worth noting that the ""state-nation"" concept advanced by Lepore is nothing new. In 1922, the German nationalist scholar Friedrich Meinecke differentiated the ""state-nation"" (Staatsnationen) from the ""culture-nation"" (Kulturnationen); see the discussion in Cobban (1969 [1945]), 108). The ""state-nation"" idea was elaborated in depth by Philip Bobbit (2002), who framed it as a general precursor to the nation-state in the European crucible of nationalism. "

Orwell was, to say the least, opposed to this kind of belief system: ""By 'nationalism' I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled 'good' or 'bad'. But secondly&mdash;and this is much more important&mdash;I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests"" (from the first page of the unpaginated on-line publication <i>Notes on Nationalism</i> - <a class='reflink' target='_blank' href='https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/notes-on-nationalism/'>The Orwell Foundation</a>.

But even if foreign military bases are excluded, some writers maintain that unequal power relations alone can generate imperial sway. For Engseng Ho, the United States is ""an empire without colonies,"" or an ""anti-colonial empire"" (2004, 225), able and inclined to dominate other states even without the ""presence of possession over expansive transnational spaces...""

Australia, for example, has intervened in several Melanesian countries in recent decades, sending in security forces when anarchy seemed impending. It did so, however, through the invitation of the states in question, and with substantial local support. An Australian-led military contingent was present in the Solomon Islands, for example, from 2003 to 2013, as part of <i>Operation Helpem Fren</i> (See RAMSI Ends: <a class='reflink' target='_blank' href='https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/ramsi-ends-whats-next-for-the-solomon-islands/'>""What's Next for the Solomon Islands?""</a> by Grant Wyeth, <i>The Diplomat</i>: June 30, 2017.) <br>Australia has also recently operated overseas detention facilities for undocumented would-be immigrants, which some scholars view as neo-imperial impositions. But Australia shuttered the Manus Regional Processing Centre in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 2017 after the PNG Supreme Court ruled that this detention facility was illegal; it shut down its ""processing facility"" in Nauru in 2019. In 2018 the Australian government closed a detention center in its own dependent territory of Christmas Island, but it might be reopened in the near future. In the case of the Nauru facility, media access had been tightly restricted, supposedly by Nauru's own government. An October 2018 issue of <i>The Guardian</i>, however, reported that the policy was actually concocted jointly by Nauru and Australia.
