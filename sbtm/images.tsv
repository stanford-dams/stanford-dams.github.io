"Bolivia’s official embrace of plurinational status has been propelled by the majority of its citizens who speak indigenous languages, primarily Quecha and Aymara. A minority of native Spanish speakers, concentrated in the eastern lowlands, have countered with a vision of independence for their own self-proclaimed “Camba nation.” Here we see two aspirational maps of such a nation, both of which effectively erase current-day Bolivia. In one version (on the right), the heavily indigenous highlands of the southwest are labeled “upper Peru.” In the more radical version (on the left), this area has been linked to neighboring regions of Peru and Chile to form an Andean “Aymara-Quechua” nation.***<b>Languages of Bolivia</b>. As can be seen on the map at left, the self-proclaimed “Camba nation” has considerable ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to the majority of Bolivia’s indigenous tribal societies. Most of these societies have tiny populations, however, so the majority of the region’s inhabitants still speak Spanish as their mother-tongue, as shown on the map to the right. Across the more densely populated southwestern highlands, by contrast, relatively few people speak Spanish as their first language.***As shown by the population density gradations on the left, the bulk of Bolivia’s population is concentrated in the Aymara- and Quechua-speaking highlands of the southwest (although not on the bleak altiplano of the far southwest). The eastern lowlands, by contrast—home to the self-proclaimed Camba nation—are more sparsely populated, with the notable exception of the fertile Santa Cruz region. The commercially oriented and fast-growing Santa Cruz region is the heartland of the separatist Camba movement."

"The Napoleonic period was a tremendously disruptive time in Europe, as the French army marched across most of the region. By 1812, all the areas within the heavy red line on this map were either directly controlled by France (the light and dark purple areas), were subservient to France (the dark blue-gray zone), or were in an enforced “alliance” with France (the light blue and yellow-orange areas). The two “allies” in the latter category, Prussia and the Austrian Empire, quickly deserted the French cause after Napoleon’s disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, playing a major role in his subsequent defeat."
1	img11	"016,017"	0***0	"Until 1871, the German lands were intricately divided. The German Confederation (bounded by the heavy red line), a relatively powerless successor to the Holy Roman Empire, was riddled with enclaves and exclaves. On the one hand, it encompassed several non-German areas (including today’s Czechia and Slovenia as well as the Dutch region of Limbourg). On the other hand, its two largest members, Prussia and Austria, held major territories outside of the confederation’s boundaries as well as within it. These two powers vied for influence among the smaller German states, whose size and power varied greatly. If some regions, like Bavaria or Saxony, were home to mid-ranked powers, others (notably Thuringia) were essentially patchworks of micro-states.***By 1871, Prussia had forged a unified, federally organized German Reich, albeit one that did not contain the German-speaking areas of the Austrian Empire. Prussia itself was greatly enlarged in the process of unification, but most of the pre-existing German states continued to exist as semi-autonomous divisions of the Reich. The new German realm annexed major territories won from France and Denmark in battle. It also defeated the Austrian Empire in the Seven-Weeks’ War (1866), forcing the Austrians to bring in the Hungarians as equal partners in a new Dual Monarchy, the Austro-Hungarian Empire."
1	img11b	"018,019"	0***0	"In the mid 1880s, Italy was a divided peninsula. The relatively rich and populous regions of Lombardy and Veneto in the northeast were under Austrian control. The most important Italian state was Sardinia, centered not on the island of the same name but in Italy’s northwestern region of Piedmont. Much of central Italy lay under the ecclesiastical rule of the Pope.***Italian unification was a gradual process, led by the Kingdom of Sardinia with major help from France. The process was essentially complete by 1870, when the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome and its environs. The small republic of San Marino retained its independence, as it does to this day."

"As a complex multi-ethnic state, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was ill-adapted to the environment of ethno-nationalism, which intensified in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As can be seen in the map and accompanying chart, German speakers constituted less than a quarter of the population of the Empire. They were also highly concentrated in the western portion of the realm, with outlying pockets of German speakers found elsewhere (mostly in cities). Hungarians accounted for less than 20 percent, and were a clear minority even within the officially Hungarian portion of the empire."

The creator of this 1877 map tried to indicate local mixtures with diagonal striping. (Interestingly, pink here stands for “Musselmans” [Muslims], the only religious category in the key). There is no corresponding color for Christians. Two other linguistically distinct groups, the mostly itinerant Roma (“Gypsies”) and the Ladino-speaking Jews, are not indicated on the map, even though roughly half the residents of Thessaloniki were Jewish.

The designer of this 1918 map highlighted the ethnic diversity of the Russian far west through contrasting color blocks: teal for the Poles, red for Lithuanians, yellow for Estonians, brown for Belarussians, and dark green for Ukrainians. Patchier areas appear across the light-green sea of Russian speakers as well, including a rust-colored archipelago of Volga Tatars.***The Russian imperial census of 1897 revealed that ethnic Russians accounted for just 44% of the empire’s population (a figure that was still significantly higher than that of Germans in Austria-Hungary). Adding the closely related Ukrainians and Belarussians, the overall proportion of eastern Slavs in the empire was roughly two-thirds."

"Ethnographic mapping was an important process in determining the new boundaries that would be established in central and eastern Europe after World War 1. This 1918 map, which figured prominently in the formation of the new state of the southern Slavs, can be read as making a case for the new state’s ethnic cohesion. The multi-linguistic, multi-confessional zone that would be become the independent country of Yugoslavia is mapped here as a continuous color spectrum, running from light blue through dark blue to dark green—a scheme that visually minimizes the differences between the peoples who would be brought together within Yugoslavia’s borders."

But not all states agreed to join, and several that did join were not, strictly speaking, nation-states but rather empires with extensive overseas holdings. On this retrospective Wikipedia map, grey shows the extent of non-member states in 1920, while bright blue is used to dramatize the colonial holdings of League members. In an unusual maneuver, Tibet proper is mapped as a colony of China, with neighboring areas inhabited primarily by Tibetans shown in mixed diagonal striping. The areas depicted in orange, denoting “mandated territories,” were also in effect colonial holdings. We have modified the map with a blue outline around British India to call attention to another anomaly: namely, while the subcontinent was ruled by Great Britain at the time, it was nonetheless granted League membership in its own right."

None of these states was a precursor polity of modern Nigeria.***Here the boundaries of Nigeria (again outlined in red) are superimposed on a more ambitious historical map of West Africa: one that attempts to show the overlapping territories of powerful states that came and went during different periods. The picture may be muddled, but the point is clear: even over this longer sweep of time, no premodern polity corresponds to modern Nigeria.***This map highlights the linguistic diversity of Nigeria and its neighbors, Benin, and Cameroon.

Vojvodina was given a measure of autonomy because of its ethnic diversity. Although it had a Serbian majority, it also contained sizable numbers of Hungarians, Slovaks, Croatians, and others. Vojvodina is still classified as an autonomous province of Serbia.***After the end of the Cold War, Yugoslavia fell into civil war. Eventually, all of its old republics became independent states situated within their preexisting boundaries. Kosovo later gained <I>de facto</I> sovereignty, and is recognized as an independent country by the United States and many other countries.***This map is identical to the preceding one, with one exception: Kosovo is erased. The United Nations does not recognize Kosovo’s independence, regarding it as a wayward province of Serbia.***Here we see yet another representation of political geography in the former Yugoslavia, privileging <I>de facto</I> control over diplomatic recognition.

"The Holy Roman Empire undoubtedly oversaw the most intricate political arrangements found in early modern Europe. Among its most important subdivisions were the Imperial Circles: administrative units responsible for adjudicating disputes, providing defense, and collecting imperial taxes. The territories falling under a given Imperial Circle were not necessarily contiguous, as can be seen on the pock-marked shape of the Swabian Circle, visible on the right. The close-up of the same Circle on the left reveals its complicated internal geography: a patchwork of territories, ruled by scores of different lords.***The geopolitical intricacy of the Holy Roman Empire is also manifest at the level of its constituent states. Here we see the fractured Prince-Bishopric of Leige, an ecclesiastical realm located mainly in today’s Belgium.***A large number of the constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire were ecclesiastical realms, highlighted here in purple. Such theocracies were especially numerous in the west-central portion of the Empire.***This map modifies the previous one by recasting the ecclesiastical lands in black, making them more easily visible."

This figure reveals that the political map of Europe remained extraordinarily intricate after 1648. The western portion of the Holy Roman Empire in particular retained dozens of micro-states that did not fit the supposed Westphalian model of territorial state sovereignty.***Several important states gained territory with the Peace of Westphalia, as is depicted on this map."

"Older historical maps (like this one) often stamp the simple label “Poland” on the territory that was ruled by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth—a decentralized federation with an elected monarch. This widely reproduced map from the late 1800s shows the extent of the Commonwealth’s holdings in 1648, immediately after the Peace of Westphalia.***The Polish-Lithuanian state is shown more accurately in this Wikipedia image. Here the polity is labeled as “Poland & Lithuania,” with an additional label noting that it was at the time in personal union with Saxony (that is, sharing a single monarch). The map does not, however, differentiate Polish from Lithuanian territory within the Commonwealth.***Before the Union of Lublin in 1569, Poland and Lithuania were separate states, linked together only by their shared monarch. As the bright yellow on this map dramatizes, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ruled a larger territory than the Crown of Poland (whose lands are shown here in a paler shade of yellow). Note that the Duchy of Prussia—marked by gold stripes—is mapped here as a sub-fief of the Polish Crown. In practice, this “fief” was essentially an independent state at the time, even though its ruler had accepted the king of Poland—his uncle—as his titular liege.***After the Union of Lublin in 1569, Poland-Lithuania can more easily be framed as a singular state. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of Poland, however, retained their own territorial realms. The territory of Poland (shown here in pink) grew at the expense of Lithuania (purple), as can be seen by comparing this map with the previous one. Here we also see several fiefs of the Commonwealth, which were largely independent realms. The smallest of these—the light-gray sliver area below Latvia—was the Duchy of Courland, which (astonishingly) established its own short-lived overseas empire, briefly controlling several forts in what is today The Gambia (from 1651-1660), as well as the island of Tobago in the Caribbean (off and on from 1654-1689)."

Historical maps rarely show this particular union, even though they routinely depict other dynastic formations. This exception, a map of Europe at the time of the French Revolution (from <I>The Map Archive</I>), notes that Great Britain was in personal union with the Electorate of Hanover in 1789, identifying this in small print.

"The Basque Kingdom of Navarre was an important medieval state, albeit one whose territory fluctuated over the centuries. Most of Navarre was conquered by the united Crowns of Castile and Aragon between 1512 and 1524, and later annexed by the kingdom of Spain; it retained its own laws and institutions, however, in some ways forming a state in its own right for another three centuries. The northernmost part of the kingdom escaped Spanish conquest and for a time retained its status as an independent kingdom, albeit one that was personally united with France. The French state absorbed it, however, in 1620.***"

"The birth of Spain as a state is customarily dated to 1469, when Isabella of Castile married Ferdinand of Aragon, but the actual story is much more complicated, as can be seen in this sequence of maps. The full merging of Isabella’s and Ferdinand’s kingdoms took nearly 250 years. The initial joining of crowns through a temporary dynastic arrangement (personal union) was followed by the gradual creation of a combined Kingdom of Spain, whose institutions took root over the course of the sixteenth century. For another century, however, the separate crowns of Castile and Aragon continued to exist as Spanish sub-polities with distinct legal systems. Full legal union would come only with the Nueva Planta decrees of 1715-1716. Meanwhile, many other territories, both in Europe and elsewhere, were under the rule of the Spanish monarchy at different points in time. From 1580 to 1640, Portugal, along with its global empire, was under the ultimate authority of Madrid.*** *** *** *** *** *** "

While militarily allied with its Swiss neighbors, it was not a member of the Swiss Confederacy. As this map shows, the Confederacy was a composite entity. Neuchâtel joined up in 1815, even though it would remain for two more decades a principality, now under the rule of the King of Prussia. In 1848—the same year that Switzerland transformed itself into a sovereign federation—Neuchâtel threw off Prussian rule. Prussia sought to regain control, finally giving up in 1867."

"In his monumental work <I>The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History</I>, Philip Bobbitt argues that the Treaty of Westphalia represented not a single watershed but one of five stages in the gradual evolution of the modern territorial state. His schema is abstract, to be sure, but it captures the gradualism of a process that is often treated as a one-time event."
